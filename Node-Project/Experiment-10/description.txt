Title:- CLI Employee Management System Using Node.js and Arrays

COMPONENT: EmployeeManagement (CLI Application)

Purpose:
Provides a command-line interface for managing employees (name + ID) using Node.js and arrays.

Features:
Add Employee → Prompts the user to input an employee’s name and ID, then stores them in memory.
List Employees → Displays all employees currently stored in memory.
Remove Employee → Removes an employee from the list by matching their ID.
Exit → Ends the program.
Effect:
Demonstrates handling synchronous user input/output using Node.js readline module with an interactive menu loop.

FILE: employeeManagement.js (or index.js)

Purpose:
Implements the complete CLI system for employee management.

Key Functionalities:
State Variable:
employees[] → Stores the current list of employee objects with {id, name}.
Menu System:
showMenu() → Displays options and routes to appropriate handlers.
Handlers:
addEmployee() → Collects employee name and ID, stores them in memory.
listEmployees() → Prints all employees with index, name, and ID.
removeEmployee() → Finds an employee by ID and removes them.
Exit Handling:
Option 4 gracefully closes the program (rl.close()).

LEARNING OUTCOMES
Learned how to use Node.js readline for CLI-based user interaction.
Practiced state management with arrays in memory.
Understood how to implement a menu-driven program loop with switch cases.
Improved ability to structure input validation and CRUD operations in a console app.
